* [**Racquetball games simulation**](https://github.com/st33ze/pythonIntroToCS/blob/master/racquetball/racquetball.py) - The program simulates Racquetball games between two players A and B. It prompts for two winning probability values and amount of games to simulate. Then it executes simulation and finally presents the results.
* [**Cannonball**](https://github.com/st33ze/pythonIntroToCS/blob/master/cannonball) - Simulation of projectile. Outputs distance the projectile traveled and maximum height, depending on given height, initial velocity, angle and time interval. Simulation
counts flight near earth surface and ignores wind resistance.
