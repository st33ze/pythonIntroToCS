This repository contains chosen TODO programming tasks, given in  the book "Python Programming - Introduction to Computer Science" by John Zelle. Purpose of the repository is to practice Python programming language, with git version control, markdown syntax etc.

* [**Racquetball games simulation**](https://github.com/st33ze/pythonIntroToCS/blob/master/racquetball/racquetball.py) - The program simulates Racquetball games between two players A and B. It prompts for two winning probability values and amount of games to simulate. Then it executes simulation and finally presents the results.
* [**Cannonball**](https://github.com/st33ze/pythonIntroToCS/blob/master/cannonball) - Simulation of projectile. Outputs distance the projectile traveled and maximum height, depending on given height, initial velocity, angle and time interval. Simulation
counts flight near earth surface and ignores wind resistance.
* [**Student**](https://github.com/st33ze/pythonIntroToCS/blob/master/student) -
Student managing tool, that allows to: list students from a file, output students with best GPA score, add grades to existing records, add new students and save list to a file.
* [**Numbers**](https://github.com/st33ze/pythonIntroToCS/blob/master/numbers/numbers.py) - Module with operations on numbers and lists. Contains functions that generate prime numbers based on given range, by using Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm; check if given number is a prime number; or return list only with natural numbers based on given list.
* [**Palidrome**](https://github.com/st33ze/pythonIntroToCS/blob/master/palidrome.py) - A palidrome is a sentence, that contains the same sequence of letters reading it either forwards or backwards. Example: "Able was I, ere I saw Elba.". The program tries to assess, if given sentence is a palidrome using recursive functions.
